Description: 

This is a project from one of my art classes where we were tasked to create an interactive website using p5js and HTML+CSS. 
The prompt was to create a retro-themed website based on popular media in the late 90s and early 2000s. My website focuses
on the game Final Fantasy VII and is designed to be a website to advertise and market the game. 

Updates: 
05-30-2024:
* There were some issues with controlling the character in the map. The character is now controlled by mouse movement instead of keyboard. 
* Navigating the map is still being updated to function more consistently with changing screen resolutions.
* Every other function still works as expected and maybe more functions will be added soon.
